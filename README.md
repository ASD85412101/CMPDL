# CMPDL (Curse Modpack Downloader)
### A lightweight alternative to Twitch App for downloading Minecraft modpacks.

---

CMPDL is a Java application created by Franckyi, based on [Vazkii's project](https://github.com/Vazkii/CMPDL). It allows you to download your favorite modpacks from websites like [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/modpacks) or [Feed the Beast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks). For users who don't like the Twitch App and still want to enjoy Minecraft modpacks, this app is made for you !

This project is under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

### As this project is based on the JavaFX framework, UNIX system users must install OpenJFX or Oracle's JDK to start the application.

What changed between Vazkii's version and my version ?

- A revamped user interface
- Support for mods.curse.com website
- The user can choose the destination path

## How to use ?

- Paste the modpack URL in the "Modpack URL" field.
- If you want to download a specific version, put the file ID in the "File ID" field.
- Select the destination folder. If you use MultiMC, create a new folder in the "instances" folder and select it.
- Press "Start Download" and wait.
- Forge won't be installed. The recommended Forge version to install will be shown in the log and in the MultiMC instance notes. You can also install a newer version, but if it breaks, go back to the recommended version.
