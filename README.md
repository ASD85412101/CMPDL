# CMPDL

**Curse Modpack Downloader**

Downloads modpacks from curse, given a URL. Experimental. Forked from Vazkii's project with a new UI.

Licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). Have fun.

## Usage Instructions
 
 * Download CMPDL on the [Releases](https://github.com/Franckyi/CMPDL/releases) page. Run it.
 * Find the pack you want. We'll use [Proton](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/proton) as an example.
 * Copy the URL of the project home on CurseForge. It should look like the one on the last point. Paste this URL on the "Modpack URL" field on CMPDL.
 * To specify a version of the modpack, enter that version in the "File ID" field
 * Choose the modpack destination. If you use MultiMC, choose a new folder under the "instances" folder.
 * Press "Start Download" and wait.
